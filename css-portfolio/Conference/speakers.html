        <h5>Designing a culture of design</h5>
        <p>
          Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a
          beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
          corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
          motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a
          workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel
          valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows
          it to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of
          organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share
          what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t,
          and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s
          culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost
          impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
        </p>

        <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design inspiration from filmmakers</h5>
        <p>
          Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a
          combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling
          technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so
          they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to
          focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the
          many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design
          and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll
          look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat
          sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we
          might look to them for inspiration.
        </p>
        <h5>About Adam</h5>
        <p>
          Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about
          collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an

          computer science, film, and animation to create effective and
          easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter
          how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story;
          uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares
          his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com and discussingdesign.com.

          that our code is ready for production? This talk will share tips on
          how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to remove
          buggy code through testing.

        <p>
          Perception influences decisions, especially when it comes to selling
          products and services. Learn why before you even start sales
          conversations; good, thoughtful design and presentation will define
          you and your ability to close deals.

        <h5>Death to wireframes: Long live rapid prototyping</h5>
        <p>
          Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping
          makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static
          wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid
          prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster;
          it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill
          your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.

          trying to solve. They improve our consistency, which provides a better
          experience for our users. And they help us grow, a valuable asset in
          times of innovation.
